    <h1>HTML Wiki</h1>
    <p>You're at the homepage of this wiki.</p>
    <h2>Experimental</h2>
    <p>
      This project is an experiment to make a wiki or CMS (content management
      system) where the wiki entries or content are stored in HTML files on
      disk. But those HTML files are not the final desired presentation; those
      original, raw content HTML files hold their content in their
      <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> and metadata in their <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>.
      To present the content, processes extract and transform that body content
      into more complete HTML using the given metadata.
    </p>
    <h2>Why?</h2>
    <p>
      Contrast with most (so far as I understand) wikis, CMS's, and static site
      generators which store the content of their entries in a database and
      transmute them into HTML pages using templating languages. I've always
      felt templating languages were awkward. So this concept is based on
      subjective intuition more than any conceptual, theoretically strong basis.
    </p>

    <p>
      But am I not going to end up with a templating language of my own, even if
      I resist and try to make something up? The core thing which a templating
      engine achieves is to replace content in a document with other content
      from some other document (transclusion), right? And if I want to take
      content from one HTML file and put it into another, isn't that just a
      templating language?
    </p>

    <p>
      There's also the other thousand things templating languages do which are
      vital and not to be downplayed. I should probably do a proper survey of
      features which I might end up needing to replicate, but here's a short
      list off the top of my head of wheels I am signing up to reinvent:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>HTML Escaping</li>
      <li>
        Content enumeration and mapping, e.g.
        <code
          >articles.map(({ href, title }) =&gt; `&lt;li&gt;&lt;a
          href={href}&gt;{title}&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;)</code
        >
      </li>
      <li>Structured front-matter/metadata</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      I wonder if I can use HTML <code>&lt;template&gt;</code> and/or
      <code>&lt;slot&gt;</code> elements to achieve an HTML-native templating
      experience. Normally these elements are activated and replaced in-browser
      either automatically or via JavaScript. Maybe this is like a "server-side
      rendered" version of that? Maybe if I put <code>&lt;slot&gt;</code>'s into
      my pages, then they become templates themselves. So I won't be avoiding
      the concept of templating languages, but instead using HTML's existing
      semantics (albeit in a novel place and time on the server).
