Implementing the create page made a funny bug. At first I just copied and pasted the edit page, with the same form. And it seemed to work! Except... it edited the current page, just like the edit form. Which meant it wasn't creating a new page, it was overwriting the Create page. Almost lost all my work on creating that page. Facepalm. Luckily my text editor's undo worked on the changes made elsewhere. Whew.

I began work on the `create` template and functionality. An idea I cribbed from TiddlyWiki was to name a new file with a timestamp. That led me to want a syntax for inserting a value into an `input` tag's `value` attribute. My only templating concept so far was to use `slot` tags. Was there another HTML-first or otherwise-web-first method for targeting a certain attribute? I thought about making a surrounding `slot` tag with attributes pointing to the element, attribute, and value which should be set within it. I also thought of some special global attributes, like `x-set`. I wanted to avoid non-standard syntax for the attribute values themselves, like how many templating languages use curly braces to signify calculated attributes, e.g. `<input value={inputValue} />`. That syntax makes sense if you already take it as a given that you're not writing HTML, but something which resolves to HTML. I wanted to write HTML.

I realized there was a whole part of the spec I hadn't used yet, custom elements. What if I made a templating DSL which used specific custom elements? The names and attributes together would be more than enough expressiveness, I thought. For example, how about if I declared what element to replace the custom element with, and how? E.g.

```html
<replace-with input value="{value}" />
```

And the way I had used `slot` elements up to this point could also be replaced with semantically named custom elements, like:

```html
<remove-if true="{value}">...</remove-if>
<keep-if true="{value}">...</keep-if>
```

Those values could also be queries.

[TiddlyWiki][tiddlywiki]'s expressive filter language enabled many emergent usecases, but ever since I began using TW, I always resisted learning it. I read the [history of the syntax][tiddlywiki-filter-syntax-history] page (which coincidentally had only been added a few days prior?) which confirmed a suspicion: the features had acreted over time after its inception as a clever riff on the classic wiki link syntax. I wanted to reflect on the total goals of the query language, the successes and failures of other languages including TW's, and ensure queries were a first class citizen with a thoughtful structure.

I wanted my query language to sensibly fit into a URL path as well as it fit into attributes in the templating language. That felt like a powerful hypermedia-focused constraint. That would empower users to use the same language whether they were adding client-side features or server-side.

I considered whether this should effect my prior decision to use the top-level of the path to direct to pages/entries. Maybe pages should have their own top-level path, e.g. `https://my.wiki/p/About.html`, and queries could have their own too, e.g. `https://my.wiki/q/pages titled like About`. In fact, maybe `p/About` was its own query? It's querying for a page! In that case, the top level path would be a query.

Up to this point, I only had "raw" HTML pages, but I wanted to support Markdown. I thought I could identify what content the HTML page stored via a [`<meta>` tag][mdn-meta-tag] in the `<head>`. That led me to the [`itemprop` attribute][mdn-itemprop-attribute] which seemed perfect for the job. So I'd differentiate Markdown content from "just a normal HTML page" with a tag like `<meta itemprop="content-type" content="markdown">`.

What did it mean for the Markdown content to exist within HTML? I thought of two clear possibilities.

My first idea was that the only contents of the `<body>` tag would be plain Markdown text. Unfortunately, I knew that if someone ever opened this HTML page in a browser with no additional CSS, the page would look bad as all the whitespace would be messed up. I could solve that with a small touch of CSS, though.

My second idea was that the Markdown would be within a `<code><pre>` combination which was the standard for presenting plaintext in a webpage because browsers formatted such text how you would expect to see it in your text editor, with preserved whitespace and a monospace font, without any custom CSS. The downside of this approach was that there would still be "HTML content" in the file which in my head was ideally only "markdown content".

So it seemed like I was either going to end up adding some extra CSS or some extra HTML to my "raw markdown in HTML" file. So be it. Maybe I could try both and see which I liked more?

Future: I searched for a way to embed content in HTML which would escape any internal HTML without an external process. I couldn't think of one off the top of my head, but hopefully that was a blind spot which I could fill in, not a signal that the concept was misguided.

I created a markdown file (in HTML) to test with (probably this one you're looking at!). I started to write it in a ["logbook" format][reeds-website-logbooks] I enjoy. I backdated some content in the logbook to explain the project's origins.

I named the file with a file extension `.html`, because it was an HTML file. I realized that my text editor didn't love this. It attempted to format the page as HTML over and over and failed to do so, because I'd written so many HTML tags in Markdown code snippets. Sorry formatter :( Still, I overcame this pretty easily by telling my text editor that, despite the file extension, this was indeed a Markdown file. Then it didn't try to format anything at all. Whew.

I tried the version with the `<code><pre>` first, and I found an interesting unintended side effect. When I tried to view the page "raw", The text was formatted okay, though there was no line wrap so long paragraphs created a horizontal scroll, which meant even with this method I'd be adding some CSS to make it pretty. Far weirder was that all the code blocks which I'd written which contained HTML tags, such as `<button>`, the browser did its best to try to make sense of as HTML. No process was escaping those as I had imagined. I don't know why I imagined that, I just didn't think that far ahead. This was a fun surprise! The page felt properly fun and weird with all the random HTML elements strewn all over and the formatting messed up. But it probably wasn't a very useful view.

Next, I made my server recognize the `meta` tag and render the Markdown into HTML when displayed.

I added a query parameter option via `?raw` to skip this rendering step and see the original HTML page.

Then I made the `?edit` page also only put the Markdown textual content within the editable area. Of course, I also had to make the save functionality also only replace the markdown content.

And finally the other side where `?edit&raw` brings you back to the normal, full HTML page edit experience even if you have a different content-type.

Future: I finally added tests for save functionality. There were a lot of use-cases to cover, with the various `raw` and `content-type` combinations.

At [HTML Day 2025][html-day-2025] in [Portland][html-day-2025-pdx], I got the "edit" page to actually work and submit edits! It was really fun to edit the pages.

I also made the edit page a normal entry, which is a trick I learned from [TiddlyWiki][tiddlywiki]. So the edit page itself existed at `/$/templates/edit`. And you could edit that page as easily as any other by adding `?edit` to edit itself! Trippy.

Someone at HTML Day pointed out that you could easily break the whole site by removing the `<slot>` and `button` from the edit page, thus disallowing any further edits to any page. Fun!

This idea came to me as I used and enjoyed [TiddlyWiki][tiddlywiki] (TW) more and more. I always used TW the [Node Web Server mode of TW][tiddlywiki-node] mode because it simplified the persistence model for me; I wanted the files on my harddrive, to edit them in my text editor sometimes, to sync them across my devices with [Syncthing][syncthing], and I also wanted to back them up in GitHub (note using Syncthing and `git` together isn't recommended).

As I used this combination, I yearned for a more "web-first" version. TW is web-first in the sense that its origins are as a single page application using only HTML, CSS, and JS's powers combined to create a wiki. But that origin story doesn't include external persistence. Instead, amazingly, TW's original model is to use no server whatsoever and still achieve persistence! It did so (and still does so!) via the browser's "download" functionality. Other [varied external persistence](tiddlywiki-saving) models have since been added on to widen TW's use cases.

The "web-first" that I'm more interested in is one which is more inclusive of how the web works in total, not just how a webpage works once its inside the browser. I want to see what a wiki would look like with a strong foundation in hypermedia (see [Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State (HATEOAS)][hateoas]).

I searched around the internet and I couldn't find an existing strong example of what I was thinking of, which surprised me. Every wiki, CMS, static site generator, dynamic blog, etc, which I could find or think of used one of two models, a database or "raw" content files. In the former, content existed solely in a database until requested, at which point the server extracted it and transformed it into a presentable HTML page. The latter model was much the same, except that files existed on disk, identified by file extension (`.md`) and [front matter][jekyll-front-matter].

I decided to just try building my idea. My first thought was, "what if every page in this wiki were an entire HTML file?" Everything else fell out from there. At the base level, I'd need a web server to transmit those files to the browser and receive updates.

I started by copying and pasting a previous NodeJS & Express web-server from a previous project. At first, it was just a simple web server which would present local files.

Then I made an "edit" page which did the first interesting thing. When I presented the edit page, I would replace the `<slot name="content">` element with the content of the file of the page I wanted to edit. I put that `slot` inside a `<textarea>` and voila, I could edit the text!

At first I thought it would be cool if you could add "commands" onto the end of the path, e.g. to use the edit command on `/posts/my-first-post.html`, you'd append `/edit` to make it `/posts/my-first-post.html/edit`. But I soon saw a conflict if someone named a file the same as those commands, e.g. `about/commands/edit`. Should that take you to a page called "About the Edit Command,", or the edit page for "About Commands"? What's wrong with either convention other than the arbitrary rule I'd made up? So I moved those commands into query parameters instead, which made the first example work like `/posts/my-first-post.html?edit` instead. I was super glad I had automated tests for all my expecations when I decided to make this change.

Although I had an "edit page", it didn't yet have a button to actually submit your edits, so it didn't achieve its name yet.

I was excited, and I wanted to work all night on it, but I made myself go to bed at a reasonable hour to have the energy for [HTML Day][html-day-2025] the next day.
