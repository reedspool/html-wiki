# Markdown File Title

A simple markdown file to test whether stuff works.

Here's an external link to [Google](https://www.google.com).

## Second heading

Here's **bold** and _emphasized_ formatted text

Here's a [reference link][index].

Here's a [/shortcut reference link with no associated reference link definition]. I use a trick to generate reference link definitions for these on the fly.

And some `inline code` as well as a codeblock:

```js
// Comment
const log = () => console.log("log!");
```

Now here's some HTML content within inline code `<code><pre>`.

[index]: /index "Reference link to index"
